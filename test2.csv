Title of Page: Google Drive desktop app: Is support possible in the future?
Link of Page: http://redd.it/2hhlft
Body of Page Below: 
Just wondering about the possibility of supporting Google Drive locally on GVSU computers. I like using Google Drive (with my gvsu login) because it lets me easily store, manage, and backup my entire academic career (up to 30gbs worth!). I have been archiving my work on Google Drive for the past few semesters, and I frequently use Drive's web interface to reference past documents, lectures, and homework assignments. 

I think it would be pretty awesome if the Google Drive desktop app was supported on campus computers. In other words, I would really like to be able to login to windows, then have access to all my files on Google Drive by accessing it via MyComputer. Using the Google Drive app for Windows is much more user-friendly then using the web interface, and it is easier to manage when it comes to archiving in-progress course work. 

Just a suggestion that I thought would be cool to look into, especially since Grand Valley already contracts Google's web services. Thoughts? Feel free to discuss logistics (is this too much of a hurdle to integrate?)

*edit: forgot a word :/

Title of Page: Nepotism at GVSU
Link of Page: http://redd.it/2f19f3
Body of Page Below: 
Thoughts on this? 

* [Gleaves Whitney](http://hauensteincenter.org/staff/), Director of The Hauenstein Center for Presidential Studies at Grand Valley State University, hired his step-daughter [Brenna Cleary](http://hauensteincenter.org/common-ground-workshops/) as the "Community Outreach and Research Coordinator" for The Hauenstein Center for Presidential Studies at Grand Valley State University

* [Maribeth Wardrop](http://www.gvsu.edu/gvnow/?articleId=9CEBE7BC-EDCB-0F36-AE28AF303A15538A) retired from her position of "Vice President for University Development for Grand Valley State University" in 2011. Guess who holds that position now? Her daughter (or daughter in law) [Jennifer Wardrop](https://secure.gvsu.edu/giving/contact-424.htm).

* GVSU Athletic Director Tim Selgo hired his son-in-law Matt Mitchell as the current head football coach (one of the highest-paid positions in GVSU athletics). At that time, many arguments were made about Mitchell not being the most qualified candidate for the job. He was hired anyway.

This type of stuff would not fly at other universities and is quietly swept under the rug here.

Title of Page: GVSU Admissions Standards: 2000-2013

Body of Page Below: 
Following the discussion regarding the shortage of on-campus housing, it was suggested that the incoming freshman class grows year after year while the admissions standards remain stagnant. Is it time to start taking quality over quantity? 

I was curious, so I compiled some basic data: 

* Mean HS GPA (2000-2013)

* Mean ACT Score (2000-2013)

* Freshman Class Size (2000-2013)

All of this data is publicly available from the GVSU Office of Institutional Analysis.

Salutations GVSU comrades! I'm a transfer student, this is my second year of college. I like to draw a lot, and I was wondering if there was a good place to scan images on campus, considering I don't have a scanner.   
  
Any insight you guys could provide would be awesome!

Title of Page: So, anyone else super disappointed in their FA package this year?
Link of Page: http://redd.it/26bm4i
Body of Page Below: 
I know myself and a few of my friends all had our aid severely decreased this year. No change in income, grades, and we're all upperclassmen; and we all lost thousands in aid compared to previous years. Did this just happen to occur to all of us, or is GVSU just not giving out as much aid this year?

Title of Page: Help! I need advice with a grading situation.
Link of Page: http://redd.it/23vhto
Body of Page Below: 
**This will be kind of tough to follow. I apologize.**  

Hey all. I just finished a class with a very nice history prof. Like, regarded as one of the best at GVSU; however, his class was not very organized this time around (it's his last time teaching it for a while). The grading criteria was supposed to be a midterm (multiple choice), a final (multiple choice) and a few quizzes. Here's how everything went down:  

* We took midterm 1. Along with the class, I got a low grade (73%). He came into class the next week and told us we could write a 2 page paper as many times as we wanted to replace the grade with an A. I wrote a quality paper, but the grade was never changed nor the paper ever handed back (he's not good at Blackboard).  
* We took a few assorted quizzes where I scored well. Probably 25/30 points.  
* We had a quiz that counted as extra credit. I got a couple points out of 10.  
* Instead of taking a final, he changed it to another 2 page paper. He told us to spend only about an hour and a half on it with no citations or anything and bring it to his office. Very simple and informal. I got a better grade (91%), even though there was no criteria or rubric.

Anyway, my final grade is an 82% (the average of the 2 grades). I emailed him to confirm this wasn't the actual final grade since we did all those other assignments, but he said he factored all of it in as extra credit on the final exam (?).  

I'm in the process of figuring this out with him, but if he goes with that grade, what options do I have as far as appealing it? Do you think I have a case? I kind of need A-level grades right now and feel I did the work to receive one this time around. Thanks in advance, everyone.

**TL;DR:** Disorganized class, did a bunch of work that seemingly didn't count, received an arbitrary grade, wanting to appeal.  

**EDIT:** He just bumped my final exam up from a 91% to a 92%. I now have an 83% (B instead of B-). Still not the best given that I have no idea what his rubric/grading scale was for these papers.

Title of Page: After 3 months of gathering my transcripts and one month evaluation...
Link of Page: http://redd.it/23dkat
Body of Page Below: 
The admissions office of my old school messed up my old transcript and added grades from a college I never attended and that took a long time to be fixed. For another transcript for a school I went to in Japan, it took forever to figure out the payment method. I walked about a mile in ten degree weather in New York City to gather all my transcripts from previous colleges I've attended. Since I've moved to MI, I've visited GVSU countless times and was in awe of the beautiful campus. For the past four weeks, I've been checking my mailbox and leaving disappointed. But finally...

I've been accepted for summer semester :]

Title of Page: Still waiting on my admissions letter... Also, I have NO idea what I want to major in! (little 2am rant...)
Link of Page: http://redd.it/22zfn7
Body of Page Below: 
Ugh. I think about this day and night. I was a psychology student at my old University but I have no interest in being a psychologist. I'm just really interested in crazy people. I thought about taking up Criminology since I've always read case files in my spare time and watch a lot of crime TV but again, my own insecurities and fears eat at me and I become unsure. I thought about becoming a Classics major but I'm scared I'm not intelligent enough... English is technically my second language and I've always fallen behind in the subject. It took me years to learn how to even properly write an essay. However, I love reading short stories and poetry. I was originally going to major in English but it's not like I want to be a teacher... 

I honestly have NO idea what I want to be "when I grow up" because I'm 24 and hoping to come back as a transfer student.  I feel like a total failure because I have no path... Only that I really want to attend GVSU because I know that is where I can get my life started. My parents have been hounding me to get my BA and to "find my career" like I'll have a job offering to be CEO of Apple tomorrow. It's really frustrating... 

How did people with the same problem deal with this? 

tl;dr wtf am I doing
